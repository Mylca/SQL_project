# SQL Engeto – Availability of Basic Food to the Public

## Context

At your analytics department of an independent organization focused on the standard of living of citizens, you’ve agreed to explore several defined research questions related to the **availability of basic food items to the general public**.

Your colleagues have already defined the main questions they aim to answer and will pass the results on to the **press department**, which will present the findings at an upcoming conference focused on this topic.

Your task is to prepare **robust data sources** that will allow:

- comparisons of food availability over time,
- insights based on average wages,
- evaluation of price development,
- and additional context from European countries (GDP, GINI index, population).

## Research Questions

1. **Do wages increase over the years across all industries, or are there some where they decline?**
2. **How many liters of milk and kilograms of bread can be bought for the average wage in the first and last comparable periods of available price and wage data?**
3. **Which category of food is increasing in price the slowest (has the lowest year-over-year percentage growth)?**
4. **Is there a year where the year-over-year increase in food prices was significantly higher than wage growth (more than 10%)?**
5. **Does the level of GDP have an impact on changes in wages and food prices?**  
   _In other words: If GDP grows significantly in a given year, does it reflect in a notable increase in food prices or wages in the same or following year?_

## Additional Data

The project also includes a table containing data on:

- **GDP**,  
- **GINI index**,  
- **Population**  

of selected European countries for the same time period as the primary analysis for the Czech Republic.
